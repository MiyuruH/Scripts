# Batch Script to Embed and Execute Python Code

This project contains a batch script that embeds Python code to display ASCII art and color it using the `pyfiglet` and `colorama` libraries. When executed, the batch script generates and shows a "Happy New Year" message in blue ASCII art.

## Requirements

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python**: Make sure Python is installed on your machine. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Python Libraries**: You need to install the `pyfiglet` and `colorama` Python libraries. You can do this by running the following commands:

  ```bash
  pip install pyfiglet colorama
bash```
  ## For Fun
  - You can change the output in the code
